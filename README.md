# AIChessGame

this is 3D chess game, all the chess pieces are animated and we apply the opponent 
with min max alpha beta pruning to let it make decisions



















current known bug
1.
inside min max controller
when the computer mock the moves, 
in the doFakeMoveSections
after it let the pawn become a queen, 
there is no logic to cope the reverse situation

2.no logic deal with en passant moves
